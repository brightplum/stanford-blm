A small percentage of women of color hold chair positions in academic medical centers; few are Black women. This year, Namandjé Bumpus, PhD, was the first Black woman to chair a department at Johns <!--more--> Hopkins University School of Medicine. This comes 156 years after Rebecca Lee Crumpler earned what is widely recognized as the first MD degree awarded to a Black woman. She attended the New England Female Medical College. Bumpus' talks about being first and her encounters of bias and racism in the article ["Dr. Namandjé Bumpus Becomes First Black Woman to Chair a Department at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"][namandje-bumpus]. Move the needle. Representation matters.
