In the paper, [Ten simple rules for building an anti-racist lab][ten-rules], authors, [V. Bala Chaudhary][chaudhary] and [Asmeret Asefaw Berhe][berhe] address <!--more--> how to build and maintain a lab environment that is anti-racist and inclusive of all Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). They note that, "building a lab that is anti-racist is very different from building a lab that simply avoids racism," and that intentional recruitment and amplifying voices of BIPOC are key elements for fostering anti-racism within indiviudal and among separate research communitites. The authors discussed this work in [an interview with KQED][interiew-kqed] on July 13, 2020.
