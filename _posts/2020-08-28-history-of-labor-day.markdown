Labor Day was founded in 1894. Earlier that year, the Pullman Strike became a national issue. Pullman porters were primarily Black men who served white <!--more--> passengers on railroad cars. [The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters][brotherhood] was created in 1925. This Black union was responsible for far-sweeping activism and their activism led to laws barring racial discrimination in employment and fairness protections for all that we commemorate on this national holiday.
