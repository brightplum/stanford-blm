The Anti-Racism Coalition, or ARC, is a staff group at the School of Medicine that joined together after the murder of George Floyd. We were angry, sad, and <!--more--> overwhelmed. We wanted to support each other and our communities. We represent several races and cultural, ethnic, and social backgrounds. Each of us experience and observe racism in a variety of ways and contexts. We recognized that while our experiences are commonplace for many, there are others in the Stanford Medicine community who stand to gain from a deeper understanding of the complexity of being Black in the United States today. With that in mind, we committed to posting a weekly article about Black Lives Matter in StanfordMed Pulse for one year. The articles highlighted issues and a variety of resources with the aim to promote commitment and action for readers to interrogate and prevent anti-Black racism at the School of Medicine. As much of our content is timeless, it continues to be available to you through the [StanfordMed Pulse Anti-Racist Coalition Black Lives Matter weekly entries][stanfordmed]. Thank you for being our readership through this journey. Our first post, one year ago, honored the life of the late U.S. Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis. So, we end our year together with one of his quotes: "Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble."
