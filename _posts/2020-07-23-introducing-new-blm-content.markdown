The Anti-Racism Coalition, or ARC, is a new staff group based at the School of Medicine. ARC plans to share content each week that contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexity of being Black in the United States today. We will share from sources such as books, noteworthy articles, events from a range of domains, and highlights of educational, intellectual, and scientific scholarship, discoveries, and news.
