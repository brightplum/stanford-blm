As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, it is worth noting that Black people have more than 1.5 times the odds of <!--more--> disabilities in later life than white people. There is a lack of research to explain these disparities, which exist throughout the lifespan. A 2011 study, [Black-White Differences in Self-Reported Disability Outcomes in the U.S.: Early Childhood to Older Adulthood][disparity-study], points to the need to identify factors in early life that account for these disparities by using data from nearly 3 million participants in the 2006 American Community Survey.
