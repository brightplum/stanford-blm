The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare racial disparities in health. In “Reproducing Racism,” the journalists at Reveal explore how this legacy of racism in health care affects maternal health in the <!--more--> United States. The episode looks at the personal stories of women of color who have been impacted by this systemic racism, the complicated legacy of J. Marion Sims, the “father of modern gynecology,” who experimented on enslaved women in the 1840s, and a calculator that may lead Black and Latinx women to C-sections. The episode ends with a conversation between two physicians from different generations reflecting on how they balance outrage with optimism while fighting for justice for all parents and babies.
