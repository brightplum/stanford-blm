            <p>The Anti-Racism Coalition, or ARC, is a staff group at the School of Medicine that joined together after
                the murder of George Floyd. We were angry, sad, and overwhelmed. We wanted to support each other and our
                communities. We represent several races and cultural, ethnic, and social backgrounds. Each of us
                experience and observe racism in a variety of ways and contexts. We recognized that while our
                experiences are commonplace for many, there are others in the Stanford Medicine community who stand to
                gain from a deeper understanding of the complexity of being Black in the United States today. With that
                in mind, we committed to posting a weekly article about Black Lives Matter in StanfordMed Pulse for one
                year. The articles highlighted issues and a variety of resources with the aim to promote commitment and
                action for readers to interrogate and prevent anti-Black racism at the School of Medicine. As much of
                our content is timeless, it continues to be available to you through the <a

                    Pulse Anti-Racist Coalition Black Lives Matter weekly entries</a>. Thank you for being our
                readership through this journey. Our first post, one year ago, honored the life of the late U.S.
                Congressman and civil rights
                leader John Lewis. So, we end our year together with one of his quotes: "Do not get lost in a sea of
                despair. Be
                hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the
                struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary
                trouble."
