The Anti-Racism Coalition, or ARC, is a staff group at the School of Medicine that joined together after the murder of
George Floyd. We were angry, sad, and overwhelmed. We wanted to support each other and our communities. We represent
several races and cultural, ethnic, and social backgrounds. Each of us experience and observe racism in a variety of
ways and contexts. We recognized that while our experiences are commonplace for many, there are others in the Stanford
Medicine community who stand to gain from a deeper understanding of the complexity of being Black in the United States
today. With that in mind, we committed to posting a weekly article about Black Lives Matter in StanfordMed Pulse for one
year from July 2020 - July 2021.
